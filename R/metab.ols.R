	# Personally, I like return() b/c it makes debugging easier. I don't know if it matters beyond that.
	# You can use return() to stop a function and have it return NULL (can't do that w/o call to return())
		# e.g.
		# test <- function () i = 1+1
		# is.null(test()) # FALSE
		# test2 <- function () {i = 1+1; return()}
		# is.null(test()) # TRUE
		# see SO post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11738823/explicitly-calling-return-in-a-function-or-not
		# I think using return() also has aesthetic benefits, 
		# so arguments for use of return() may be similar to the discussion of '=' and '<-' (please use '<-'!! <3)
	
	# notes on using attr() to simplify the output of our functions (extended from convo b/w LAW and RDB):
	# this makes it so that the results appear as the simple data frame
	# atrributes(results) shows the names of the attributes
	# attr(results, "lm.mod") will access the lm object
	# class(results) is data.frame
	# rbind(results, data.frame("NEP"=1, "GPP"=5, "R"=-1)) will provide the reasonable data frame 
	# dim(results) shows the data.frame dimensions
	# ... point i'm making is that it look and acts like a data frame, until you specifically attempt to get at lm.mod.
	# appears simple, has the functionality that is consistent w/ the simple appearence, but hides a lot of info if that info is desired
