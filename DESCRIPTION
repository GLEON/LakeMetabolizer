Description: A collection of tools for the calculation of freewater metabolism 
    from in situ time series of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and, 
    optionally, additional environmental variables. LakeMetabolizer implements
    5 different metabolism models with diverse statistical underpinnings: 
    bookkeeping, ordinary least squares, maximum likelihood, Kalman filter, 
    and Bayesian. Each of these 5 metabolism models can be combined with 
    1 of 7 models for computing the coefficient of gas exchange across the
    airâ€“water interface (k). LakeMetabolizer also features a variety of 
    supporting functions that compute conversions and implement calculations 
    commonly applied to raw data prior to estimating metabolism (e.g., oxygen 
    saturation and optical conversion models).
