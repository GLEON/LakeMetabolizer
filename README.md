===Installation Directions===

==Windows==

To install from source in Windows, the easiest way is by installing two additional tools. 

1) Install [Rtools for Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) so you have the compiler needed.
2) Install the "devtools" package

	install.packages('devtools')

With these two packages installed, you can now run these two commands from the R console to install LakeMetabolizer

    library(devtools)
	install_github('LakeMetabolizer', 'GLEON')

That should be it!
